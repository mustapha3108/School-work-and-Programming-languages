----------FHRP----------
firt hop redunduncy protocol: allows changing default gateway automatically
it's actually a type of protocols: HSRP/VRRP/GLBP
working with HSRP cuz cisco
if the priority router is not manually set, we get the one with the bigger ip address
and the rest of the priorities are set the same way
(arp request, seraching for mac address)
interval of update messages is 3 seconds
some preemption thing exists, like if the priority router comes back online
we create an identifier and a virtuall address for the group, and we give it to the pc

interface name address @
ip addreess ip mask
no shutdown
